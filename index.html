<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
<p>My name is Will Payne, and I'm the instructor for Geography N80 - Digital Worlds. This is an example of a very simple website to give you a sense of what goes into making a page out of HTML and CSS. I wanted to make this page look extremely DIGITAL... so I found this cool glitchy GIF by the artist <a href="http://maxcapacity.tumblr.com/" target="blank">Max Capacity</a>.</p>
<img src="max.gif" alt="Max Capacity digital artist" align="middle" title="Max Capacity digital artist" width="500" height="375" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-184329">
<p>This page took about five minutes to make. When you finish Lab 0, you'll be able to make a page even better than this, if you can believe it!</p>
